# BlueEarthOne CI/CD Process

This document outlines the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process for the BlueEarthOne application.

## Overview

BlueEarthOne follows a robust CI/CD pipeline that ensures code quality, automated testing, and streamlined deployments. The pipeline is designed to:

1. Verify code quality through automated linting and formatting checks
2. Run comprehensive test suites to ensure functional correctness
3. Build and deploy the application to appropriate environments
4. Perform health checks to validate successful deployments
5. Provide rollback capabilities in case of deployment failures

## Pipeline Stages

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:

### 1. Code Quality Checks

- **Linting**: Enforces code style and identifies potential issues
- **Format Checking**: Ensures consistent code formatting across the codebase
- **TypeScript Type Checking**: Validates type correctness

### 2. Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Tests individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Tests interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Tests complete user flows

### 3. Build

- Compiles the application for production
- Bundles assets
- Optimizes for performance

### 4. Deployment

- **Staging**: Deploys to the staging environment for pre-production validation
- **Production**: Deploys to the production environment after successful staging tests

### 5. Post-Deployment

- **Health Checks**: Verifies application functionality after deployment
- **Monitoring**: Tracks application performance and health
- **Rollback**: Enables quick recovery if issues are detected

## Environments

The CI/CD pipeline supports three environments:

1. **Development**: For local development and testing
2. **Staging**: For pre-production validation
3. **Production**: The live environment

## Deployment Strategy

BlueEarthOne uses a branch-based deployment strategy:

- `develop` branch → Development environment
- `staging` branch → Staging environment
- `main` branch → Production environment

## Automatic Deployments

Automatic deployments are triggered by:

- Pushes to the `develop`, `staging`, or `main` branches
- Manual triggers via the GitHub Actions workflow dispatch

## Manual Deployments

Manual deployments can be triggered using the GitHub Actions interface. This is useful for:

- Deploying specific versions
- Re-running deployments after fixing issues
- Testing specific configurations

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy follows a pyramid approach:

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, focused tests that run on every commit
- **Integration Tests**: Medium-scope tests that run after unit tests
- **E2E Tests**: Broad, slower tests that run before production deployments

## Rollback Process

If a deployment fails or introduces issues, the rollback process can be initiated:

1. Run the rollback script: `./scripts/rollback.sh`
2. Specify the target version or database backup
3. The script will handle the rest, including:
   - Reverting code changes
   - Restoring database state
   - Restarting services
   - Verifying functionality

## Infrastructure

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using:

- **GitHub Actions**: For automation and orchestration
- **AWS**: For cloud infrastructure
- **Docker**: For containerization and consistent environments
- **PostgreSQL**: For database services

## Scripts and Tools

The following scripts and tools support the CI/CD process:

- `scripts/api-test.sh`: Tests API endpoints
- `scripts/health-check.sh`: Verifies system health
- `scripts/rollback.sh`: Handles rollback operations
- `scripts/setup-e2e-tests.sh`: Sets up environment for E2E tests
- `e2e/setup/setupTestData.ts`: Prepares test data

## Monitoring and Alerts

The CI/CD pipeline is integrated with monitoring and alerting systems:

- **Health Checks**: Regularly verify system functionality
- **Performance Metrics**: Track system performance
- **Error Tracking**: Identify and report issues
- **Alerts**: Notify team members of critical issues

## Best Practices

The CI/CD process adheres to the following best practices:

1. **Automation**: Minimize manual intervention
2. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Treat infrastructure as code
3. **Idempotent Deployments**: Ensure consistent results regardless of starting state
4. **Fast Feedback**: Provide quick feedback on code changes
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all aspects of the application
6. **Reliable Rollbacks**: Enable quick recovery from issues

## Getting Started

To interact with the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **View Workflow Runs**: Visit the GitHub Actions tab
2. **Trigger Manual Deployments**: Use the workflow dispatch feature
3. **View Logs**: Check workflow run logs for details
4. **Run Locally**: Use the provided scripts for local testing

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Check Logs**: Review GitHub Actions logs for errors
2. **Verify Credentials**: Ensure all necessary secrets are configured
3. **Check Dependencies**: Verify all dependencies are correctly installed
4. **Run Tests Locally**: Execute tests locally to identify environment-specific issues
5. **Review Configuration**: Ensure all configuration files are correct

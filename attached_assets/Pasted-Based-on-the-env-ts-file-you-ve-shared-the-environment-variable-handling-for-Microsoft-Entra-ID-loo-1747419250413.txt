Based on the env.ts file you've shared, the environment variable handling for Microsoft Entra ID looks correct. The issue isn't with this file itself - it's with making sure the actual environment variables match what this file is expecting.
You don't need to update this file. Instead, you need to make sure your actual .env file contains the correct values that match these variable names. Your env.ts file is looking for these specific variables:
ENTRA_ID_ENABLED=true
ENTRA_ID_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
ENTRA_ID_REDIRECT_URI=your-redirect-uri
But I noticed in your microsoft.ts file, you're using different variable names:
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET
AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID
AZURE_AD_REDIRECT_URL
This is the mismatch I was referring to. You have two options:

Update your .env file to include both sets of variables (this is a quick fix but not ideal)
# Microsoft Entra ID SSO Configuration - Using both naming conventions
ENTRA_ID_ENABLED=true
ENTRA_ID_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
ENTRA_ID_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-replit-app.repl.co/api/auth/entra/microsoft/callback

# Duplicate values with old variable names
AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
AZURE_AD_REDIRECT_URL=https://your-replit-app.repl.co/api/auth/entra/microsoft/callback

Update your microsoft.ts file to use the same variable names as defined in env.ts (better long-term solution)
Replace the variable references in microsoft.ts to match those in env.ts:
typescriptconst msalConfig = {
  clientID: process.env.ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_SECRET,
  tenantID: process.env.ENTRA_ID_TENANT_ID,
  redirectUrl: process.env.ENTRA_ID_REDIRECT_URI || `${process.env.BASE_URL}/api/auth/entra/microsoft/callback`,
  // Rest of config remains the same
};


I recommend option 2 for better consistency, but option 1 is a quicker fix if you want to test it first.

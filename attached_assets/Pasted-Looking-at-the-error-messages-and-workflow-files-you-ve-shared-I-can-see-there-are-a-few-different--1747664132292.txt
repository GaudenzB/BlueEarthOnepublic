Looking at the error messages and workflow files you've shared, I can see there are a few different issues to address. Let me break them down:
1. GitHub Actions Workflow Error (Original Error Message)
Your initial error about invalid workflow on lines 71 and 119 with env.POSTGRES_VERSION wasn't visible in the screenshots, but this is a syntax issue. In GitHub Actions, environment variables must be referenced with proper expression syntax: ${{ env.POSTGRES_VERSION }} rather than just env.POSTGRES_VERSION.
2. Code Issues Found During CI Checks
Based on the screenshots, your push was rejected because your CI checks are failing:
a) TypeScript Error

In Image 2, there's a TypeScript error in client/src/pages/document-detail-backup.tsx (line 1257)
Error: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag for 'div'
This means you have an unclosed <div> tag in that file

b) ESLint Configuration Issue

In Image 3, ESLint is failing because:

It can't find an ESLint configuration file (eslint.config.js)
ESLint v9.26.0 is looking for a config file in the newer format
This appears to be a migration issue as ESLint changed its default configuration file format



Steps to Fix:
1. Fix the TypeScript Error

Open client/src/pages/document-detail-backup.tsx
Go to line 1257 (approximately) and find the unclosed <div> tag
Add the missing closing </div> tag or fix any mismatched tags

2. Fix the ESLint Configuration
You have two options:

Option A: Create a new ESLint config file in the new format (recommended)

Create a file named eslint.config.js in your project root
Migrate your ESLint rules to the new format per the migration guide (https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide)


Option B: Downgrade ESLint to a version that supports the older config format

Update your package.json to specify an earlier version of ESLint (e.g., "eslint": "^8.56.0")
Run npm install to apply the change



3. Fix the GitHub Actions Workflow File
For the original error with env.POSTGRES_VERSION:

Find lines 71 and 119 in .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
Replace env.POSTGRES_VERSION with ${{ env.POSTGRES_VERSION }}

4. Update Your CI Configuration
Based on Image 1, your CI-CD workflow is being modified:

Some steps for code formatting and linting are being removed or changed
The command is changing from npm run typecheck to npm run check

Make sure these modifications are intentional and consistent with your project's setup.
Recommendation:

Fix the TypeScript error first (unclosed div tag)
Then address the ESLint configuration issue
Finally, fix the GitHub Actions workflow syntax

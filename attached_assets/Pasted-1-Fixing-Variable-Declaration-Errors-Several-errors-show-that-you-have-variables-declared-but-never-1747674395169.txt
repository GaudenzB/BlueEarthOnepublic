1. Fixing Variable Declaration Errors
Several errors show that you have variables declared but never used. This is a common linting issue that's easy to fix:
For UserDetails.tsx (Line 9)
typescript// Error: 'Badge' is declared but its value is never read.
You have two options:

Use the Badge variable if it's needed
Remove or comment out the Badge import if it's not needed
Prefix with underscore to indicate intentionally unused: _Badge

For App.tsx (Multiple locations)
You have similar issues with params, user, and useLocation variables:
typescript// Error: 'params' is declared but its value is never read.
// Error: 'user' is declared but its value is never read.
// Error: 'useLocation' is declared but its value is never read.
Apply the same solutions: either use these variables, remove them, or prefix with underscore.
2. Fixing TypeScript Type Issues in App.tsx
You have type compatibility issues:
typescript// Error: Type '{{ params }: { params: any; }} => Element' is not assignable to type '() => Element'.
This typically happens when you're using props incorrectly in a component. Here's how to fix it:
typescript// Change from:
const Component = ({ params }: { params: any }) => { ... }

// To either:
// Option 1: If params is needed
const Component: React.FC<{ params: any }> = ({ params }) => { ... }

// Option 2: If params is not needed
const Component = () => { ... }
3. Testing Library Issue
typescript// Error: Cannot find module '@testing-library/react' or its corresponding type declarations.
You need to install the missing package:
bashnpm install --save-dev @testing-library/react
4. Query Observer Type Issue
typescript// Error: Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'cacheTime' does not exist in type...
This is likely because cacheTime has been renamed to gcTime in a newer version of React Query. Update your code:
typescript// Change from:
useQuery({
  cacheTime: 1000,
  // other options
})

// To:
useQuery({
  gcTime: 1000,
  // other options
})
Step-by-Step Approach to Fix All Issues

Start with App.tsx since it has the most errors:

Fix the params type errors on lines 146 and 139
Remove unused declarations for params, user, and useLocation


Fix UserDetails.tsx:

Remove or use the Badge variable


Fix tests:

Install @testing-library/react if missing
Update the React Query options in useAuth.test.tsx



Here's a more specific fix for the App.tsx params errors:
typescript// If you don't need the params at all:
// Before:
const SomeComponent = ({ params }: { params: any }) => <div>...</div>;

// After:
const SomeComponent = () => <div>...</div>;

// OR if you need to keep the params:
// Before:
const SomeComponent = ({ params }: { params: any }) => <div>...</div>;

// After:
interface ComponentProps {
  params?: any; // Make it optional if it might not always be provided
}

const SomeComponent: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ params }) => <div>...</div>;

Architecture & Modularity
Complete Module Initialization

The dynamic imports in modules/index.ts create a timing issue since they're asynchronous but the function returns synchronously
Consider refactoring to use Promise.all and await all module initializations
TypeScript Configuration

Enable stricter TypeScript checks in tsconfig.json:
"strict": true,
"noImplicitAny": true,
"strictNullChecks": true,
"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true
Core Package Dependencies

The core package has direct dependencies on server-side modules
Consider splitting core into core-common, core-client, and core-server to maintain cleaner boundaries
API & Data Handling
Standardize API Response Format

Some components still extract data inconsistently (data?.data vs data.data)
Create consistent TypeScript interfaces for API responses
Cache Management

Add proper cache invalidation strategies after mutations
Implement optimistic updates for better UX
Error Handling

Improve error handling in API requests with dedicated error boundaries
Add retry logic for transient failures
Performance & Security
Input Validation

Add comprehensive validation to all routes using Zod
Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
Authentication Enhancement

Add token refresh mechanism
Implement proper CSRF protection
Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
Performance Optimization

Implement React.memo for performance-critical components
Add code splitting for larger bundles
Component Quality
React Query Usage

Several components have unused React Query options
Add proper enabled conditions to prevent unnecessary requests
Implement proper suspense boundaries
Form Handling

Standardize form error handling
Add proper field-level validation feedback
Component State Management

Some components mix local state and global state management
Consider using React Context for shared state
Code Quality & Testing
TypeScript Usage

Fix index signature warnings (use bracket notation consistently)
Add proper typings for environment variables
Fix missing return types on functions
Testing Infrastructure

Add Jest configuration for unit testing
Implement end-to-end testing with Cypress
Add snapshot tests for UI components
Code Style & Documentation

Add JSDoc comments to exported functions and components
Create consistent error message formatting
Development Experience
Linting & Formatting

Update ESLint rules to catch common mistakes
Add pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
Development Workflow

Create npm scripts for common tasks
Add developer documentation
Specific Files Needing Attention
modules/employees/server/employeeController.ts

The validation code is duplicated - extract to a shared utility
Inconsistent error handling approach
client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts

Token management is inconsistent
Consider using React Context for auth state
client/src/pages/employee-detail.tsx

Cleanup unused imports and state
Fix TypeScript errors with proper type definitions

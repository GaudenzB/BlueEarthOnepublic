New Feature Brief: Upload-First Contract Creation with AI Extraction

Goal: Improve user experience by letting users upload documents first (without creating a contract manually), then guiding them to create or assign a contract based on AI-extracted metadata.

üß© Summary of the new process
User uploads a PDF
AI auto-analyzes the document:
Extracts: docType, vendor, effectiveDate, terminationDate, contract title, and clauses (optional)
UI presents:
Suggested values (with confidence indicators)
Option to assign to existing contract or create new contract
If ‚ÄúCreate New‚Äù is selected:
Pre-fill Contract Wizard with AI-extracted metadata
üîß Implementation Steps

1. Add new upload route & UI
New route: /contracts/upload
New component: ContractUploadFlow.tsx
This page should:

Allow PDF upload (drag/drop or browse)
Trigger analyzeDocument(file) upon upload
Show progress/loading while analysis runs
2. Extend the AI contract analyzer
Update contractProcessor.ts or analyzeContractDocument(file) to return:
{
  vendor: string | null,
  contractTitle: string | null,
  docType: 'MAIN' | 'AMENDMENT' | ...,
  effectiveDate: string | null,
  terminationDate: string | null,
  confidence: Record<string, number>,
  suggestedContractId?: string  // optional, if AI finds likely existing match
}
Reuse existing Azure Document Intelligence + GPT-4o setup
Store results in a contract_upload_ai_analysis table for traceability (optional)
3. Build ‚ÄúReview & Assign‚Äù UI
After AI completes, display a form with:
Suggested contract metadata (editable)
Confidence color-coding (red/yellow/green)
Option to:
‚ÄúLink to Existing Contract‚Äù (dropdown or search)
‚ÄúCreate New Contract‚Äù (button)
4. Hook into Contract Wizard with pre-fill
If ‚ÄúCreate New Contract‚Äù is selected:
Redirect to /contracts/new?prefillId={id}
Update Contract Wizard to accept prefillId
Load AI data from DB or memory
Pre-fill Step 1 fields and highlight them
5. Bonus: auto-assign to contract if suggestedContractId is 100% confident

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

User can upload a PDF without creating a contract manually
System shows suggested contract metadata based on AI
User can choose to link to existing or create new contract
If new, Contract Wizard pre-fills the form with AI-extracted data
All document uploads are saved and linked to the final contract record

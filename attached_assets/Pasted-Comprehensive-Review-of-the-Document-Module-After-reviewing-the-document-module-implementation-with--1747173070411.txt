Comprehensive Review of the Document Module
After reviewing the document module implementation with its recent migration from Chakra UI to Ant Design, I've identified several areas for improvement. Here's a comprehensive analysis and recommendations to enhance the document management system.

Architecture and Code Structure
Strengths
Successfully migrated from Chakra UI to Ant Design with proper component replacements
TypeScript integration with interface definitions provides type safety
Clean separation between list and detail views
Good use of React Query for data fetching and cache management
Improvement Opportunities
Component Modularization

Break down large document-detail.tsx (600+ lines) into smaller, reusable components
Extract sections like DocumentHeader, DocumentMetadata, DocumentPreview into separate components
Create a dedicated DocumentTabContent component for each tab
Code Optimization

Remove unused imports (several icons and components are imported but never used)
Optimize repetitive conditional rendering with helper functions
Refactor inline styles to use Ant Design's theme tokens and consistent styling
Error Handling Enhancement

Implement more specific error messages based on error types
Add retry functionality for failed document loading
Create dedicated error boundary components for document operations
User Experience
Strengths
Clean interface with clear visual hierarchy
Responsive design works on multiple device sizes
Proper loading states with skeleton components
Improvement Opportunities
Document Processing Status

Add estimated time remaining for document processing
Implement automatic polling for processing status updates
Add visual progress indicators for multi-step processing
Document Interactions

Implement document preview directly in the detail view for common file types
Add quick-action buttons for common operations (download, print, share)
Implement keyboard shortcuts for navigation and common actions
Empty States

Improve empty states for document tabs (comments, version history)
Add contextual guidance when no data is available
Implement interactive empty states that guide users to next actions
Data Management
Strengths
Proper use of React Query for data fetching and caching
Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
Clear API integration patterns
Improvement Opportunities
Optimistic Updates

Implement optimistic UI updates for document operations
Add rollback capabilities for failed operations
Use loading states during operations without blocking the UI
Caching Strategy

Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern for document data
Add prefetching for likely-to-be-viewed documents
Implement infinite scrolling with virtualization for long document lists
Search and Filtering

Enhance document search with advanced filters
Add saved search functionality
Implement tag-based filtering and categorization
Security and Permissions
Strengths
PermissionGuard component integration for access control
Proper handling of confidential documents
Secure download and sharing mechanisms
Improvement Opportunities
Permission Model

Refine granular permission model beyond basic view/edit/delete
Implement role-based access control templates
Add audit logging for document access and operations
Document Sharing

Enhance sharing dialog with more options (time-limited access, read-only)
Implement secure document preview for shared documents
Add notifications for document access events
Technical Debt
Missing TypeScript Types

Several components still have 'document' marked as 'unknown' type
Add proper type definitions for all document-related operations
Fix remaining TypeScript errors in document-detail.tsx
Component Migration

Complete migration of remaining UI components to Ant Design
Update alert dialogs and modals to match Ant Design patterns
Replace custom components with Ant Design equivalents where possible
Test Coverage

Add unit tests for document-related components
Implement integration tests for document workflows
Add visual regression tests for UI components
Performance Optimization
Rendering Optimization

Implement React.memo for pure components
Add virtualization for long lists of documents
Optimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays in hooks
Network Optimization

Implement query batching for related document data
Add proper throttling for rapid UI interactions
Implement progressive loading for large document lists
Suggested Next Steps (Priority Order)
Extract reusable components from document-detail.tsx to reduce complexity
Fix remaining TypeScript errors in document module
Implement optimistic updates for document operations
Enhance document processing status with progress indicators
Improve empty states with contextual guidance
Add comprehensive test coverage
